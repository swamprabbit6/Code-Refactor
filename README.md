# Code-Refactor
<!-- Code has been refactored and simplified. Comments inside the code breakdown the exact changes that were made. The CSS file was simplified with a class listed once instead of three times in five different areas. -->
<!-- Heading attributes have been added to fall in a logical and sequential order. Alt attributes have been added as well a link on the NAV bar has been fixed. The alt attributes have been added to optimize the page for search engines. 
The deployed page matches the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.  -->
